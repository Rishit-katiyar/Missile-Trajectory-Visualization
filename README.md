# Missile Trajectory Visualization ðŸš€ðŸŒŒ

Welcome to the Missile Trajectory Visualization repository! This project visualizes the trajectory of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) using Python and Matplotlib.

## Description

This project simulates the flight path of an ICBM from launch to descent. It incorporates various physical factors such as gravitational force, air resistance, and lift force to provide an accurate representation of the missile's trajectory. The trajectory is visualized in a 2D plot using Matplotlib, with different colors indicating the ascending and descending phases.

## Ballistic Path.py

The `ballistic_path.py` script contains the Python code to simulate and visualize the ballistic path of the missile. It utilizes numerical methods to calculate the trajectory and Matplotlib for plotting. 

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the script:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rishit-katiyar/Missile-Trajectory-Visualization.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Missile-Trajectory-Visualization
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the `ballistic_path.py` script:
   ```bash
   python ballistic_path.py
   ```
